In this repository, we build a very simple static website, using Render, and we built it using:
- HTML
- Python
- Object Relational Mapping
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- Render (For Deployment)


### Explanations
- The `templates` folder helps to store our HTML files, that are used to render or show our website.
- The `.env` file helps to store environmental variables.
- The `app.py` file serves as your Flask app.
- The `requirements.txt` file serves as a list of all the Python packages that your server will install to host your website.
- We explained what routes are
- We explained redirections
- We explained the `Sign Up` and `Log In` logic for a website
